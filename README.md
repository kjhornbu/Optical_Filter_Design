# Optical_Filter_Design


Multi-twist retarders are stacked liquid crystal optical elements that have continous twist within them. Thus allowing high efficiency in a thin film element.
My disseration work was to design various chromatic Multi-twist retarders. This code is a remaking the filter design aspect of my dissertation research in python as a sample of my coding ability. 

The file Multi Twist Main. py holds the functions that do the simulation work. The file cost_fuction.py is a ongoing list of cost functions utilized to minimize the MTR designs.
